## Introduction
This section provides you to How to take the input and how to print the output on console.


## Data Types

An overview of the different data types in Java, including primitives (int, char, boolean, etc.) and reference types (arrays, strings, etc.).

## Setup and Environment

Overview of the JDK,JRE and JVM

## Operations and Expressions

- Arithmetic operator and expressions
- Increment / decrement operators and expressions
- Bitwise operators

## String Class and Printing

To understand about the String objects, methods of the String class, and regular expressions.

## Conditional Statement

Understand the various control structures in Java such as if-else statements, switch cases, loops (for, while, do-while), and break/continue statements.


## Loops
➢ Loops	are	repeating	statements.	
➢ There	are	four	types	of	loops.	
➢ In	loops	the	steps	are	repeated	till	the	given	condition	is	reached.	
### while:
➢ The	steps	are	executed	if	the	condition	is	true.	
➢ The	condition	is	checked	Cirst	and	the	process	is	followed.	
➢ It	is	a	pre-tested	loop	
➢ If	the	condition	is	false	then	the	process	is	never	executed.	

### do-while:
First	the	process	is	followed	and	then	the	condition	is	checked.	
➢ It	is	a	post-tested	loop.	
➢ If	the	condition	is	false	then	the	process	is	executed	atleast	once.	
➢ The	both	loops	work	for	the	same	purpose.	
➢ But	do….while	loop	is	more	suitable	than	while	loop.	

### for
For	loop	is	a	counter	controlled	loop.	
➢ It	is	the	most	frequently	used	loop.	
➢ Syntax:for(initialization;	condition;	updation)	

### Nested loops
➢ For	loop	inside	a	for	loop	is	he	example	of	nested	loop.		 	
➢ The	above	one	is	used	commonly.	
➢ The	working	of	the	body	is	more	than	one	dimensional.	
➢ Nesting	of	any	two	types	of	loops	can	be	done.	
➢ Nested	for	loop	may	create	the	dimensional	loops.	
Example	program	for	nested	for	loop
